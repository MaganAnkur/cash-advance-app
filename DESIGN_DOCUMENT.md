# Cash Advance App Design Document

## Business Goals & User Flow

### Primary Business Goals

1. Provide users with quick access to cash advances
2. Ensure transparent fee structure and payback schedules
3. Create a seamless user experience across platforms
4. Enable offline functionality for improved accessibility

### User Flow

1. User opens app â†’ Views available advance limit
2. User initiates cash advance request
3. User enters desired amount (within limits)
4. System displays fees and payback schedule
5. User reviews and confirms request
6. System processes request and shows confirmation
7. (Offline Mode) Request queued for sync when online

## Technical Approach

### Architecture

- React Native with TypeScript for cross-platform development
- Zustand for client state management
- React Navigation for type-safe routing
- MMKV for local storage (offline support)
- Reanimated 2 for smooth animations

### Key Libraries & Tools

1. **State Management**

   - TanStack Query (React Query) for server state
   - Zustand for client state

2. **Storage & Offline**

   - MMKV for high-performance storage
   - NetInfo for network status

3. **UI/UX**
   - Custom components with potential Tamagui integration
   - React Native Reanimated for animations
   - React Native Network Info for connectivity

### Code Structure

#### State Management & Data Fetching

- React Query for server state management
- Zustand for simple client state
- MMKV for persistent storage

Rationale:

1. React Query handles caching, retries, and offline support elegantly
2. Zustand provides simpler state management with less boilerplate
3. MMKV offers better performance for storage operations

## Architecture

### State Management

- Using **TanStack Query** (React Query) for server state management
  - Handles data fetching, caching, and synchronization
  - Built-in support for offline-first functionality
  - Optimistic updates for better UX
  - Automatic background refetching
  - Efficient cache invalidation

### Navigation

- **React Navigation** with native stack navigator
  - Type-safe navigation using TypeScript
  - Native animations and gestures
  - Modal presentations for forms
  - Organized navigation structure in dedicated folder

### Network Handling

- Custom NetworkProvider for offline support
- NetInfo for network status monitoring
- Queuing mechanism for offline requests
- Automatic sync when connection is restored

## UI/UX Design

### Current Implementation

- Custom components built from scratch
- Reanimated for smooth animations
- Material Design Icons for consistent iconography
- Modern, clean interface with attention to detail

### Proposed UI Library: Tamagui

We should consider adopting Tamagui for several reasons:

1. **Performance**

   - Near-zero runtime cost
   - Optimized compilation
   - Better memory usage
   - Faster render times

2. **Developer Experience**

   - Type-safe props and themes
   - Consistent API across components
   - Built-in responsive design system
   - Excellent TypeScript support

3. **Design System**

   - Built-in themes and dark mode
   - Customizable design tokens
   - Consistent spacing and typography
   - Accessible components by default

4. **Features**
   - Animation system that works with Reanimated
   - Sheet and modal components
   - Form components with validation
   - Responsive layout primitives

### Component Structure

- Atomic design principles
- Reusable components
- Consistent styling patterns
- Responsive layouts

## Data Flow

1. API calls through TanStack Query
2. Offline support via NetworkProvider
3. Optimistic updates for better UX
4. Type-safe data handling

## Animations and Interactions

- Reanimated for smooth, native animations
- Micro-interactions for better feedback
- Spring animations for natural feel
- Loading states and transitions

## Future Considerations

1. Implement Tamagui for better component consistency
2. Add comprehensive error boundaries
3. Implement proper form validation
4. Add unit and integration tests
5. Implement proper analytics tracking
6. Add accessibility features
7. Consider implementing proper CI/CD pipeline

## Technical Debt and Improvements

1. Add proper error handling
2. Implement form validation library
3. Add loading states for all async operations
4. Improve type safety across the application
5. Add proper logging system
6. Implement proper testing strategy

## Security Considerations

1. Implement proper authentication
2. Add request validation
3. Implement proper error handling
4. Add rate limiting
5. Implement proper data encryption

## Performance Considerations

1. Implement proper caching strategy
2. Optimize bundle size
3. Implement proper code splitting
4. Add performance monitoring
5. Optimize animations for low-end devices
